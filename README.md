# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a Hardhat Ignition module that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat node
```

In another terminal

```shell
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
npx hardhat test 
npx hardhat test test/RentalMarketplace.test.js
```
